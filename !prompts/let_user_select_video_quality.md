user on frontend in setting will now see along side sign out and payment a video quality selector, which will have HD LD and ULD hd being max size of 1920 ld being 1080 and uld being 640. these will now be sent in the queue start as well.

these will be saved in local storage with nice get and set methods for them, so the queue can easily get them

when it sends that maxVideoSize variable over with the package name, redriod runner will now take it in and use it.
plan think deeply this is SO important. ask any clarifications
