we will now look at pricing page and make it better

under the stripe pricing we will have a table of those like pros and cons table other companies do

it will be maddoxcloud vs now.gg vs cloudmoon

latency: 60ms 65ms 80ms
working in school: greencheckmark | red | red
Average Queue times: 0 | 1 | 0
Pricing: free | free | 15 mins free
American Based Company: greencheckmark | red | red
Student owned: green | red | red

give a title to the table

for each column show the companies logo

make this look clean and good if anything isnt clear to the user such as for latency lower is better, let them know that somehow
