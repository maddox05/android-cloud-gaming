ok we make home page look better.

Firstly this will need to work on both mobile and desktop

the navbar will change in the navbar we will have the logo as before on the left, then to the right we will have pricing and a profile icon

- this profile icon on click when logged out will take user to login, and when logged in will show payment settings and sign out tabs
- on mobile, just show the logo (no maddoxcloud text) and the user icon and then a burger dropdown which shows the actual navbar, these should be abstracted and simple (meaning the desktop and mobile version should have copied code)
- currently the navbar blends in to much with the home page backdrop, maybe change the navbar color or smth?

under the nav bar will be the games no longer text.

under the games list will however be the text

Play Clash Royale In school (h1)
Use cloud gaming to play Mobile games for free unblocked in school (h2)

then we will have some features or reaosns people should buy

New proxy links daily (works in school)

then at the very bottom will be a button start trail
