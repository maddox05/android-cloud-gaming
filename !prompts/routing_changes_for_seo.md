❯ lets make a page when the user doesnt click the play

now on the click of anywhere but the play button, we will go into a page that displays more information about the game

the new flow will be

/app/com.X.Y/info <- can be indexed
/app/com.X.Y/queue
/app/com.X.Y/run

or skip to queue if clicked play

this new info page will be for seo.

it will look exactly like the to copy pt2.png image on my desktop.

the games list will now have a category the game is in but also instead of a desc it will now be a markdown description, which will be the desctription shown in the copy image

thier will of course be the carousl of imasges, wich the games list will now have to include, and if not images, it will show some random image as a palceholder
